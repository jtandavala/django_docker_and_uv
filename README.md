This repository contains the source code for a  project [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) set up with [docker](https://www.docker.com/)  and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The goal is to showcase how uv can be used for project management in a Django environment, while leveraging Docker for containerization. This setup demonstrates a modern and efficient workflow for developing and managing Django applications.
